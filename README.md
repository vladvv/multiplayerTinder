## multiplayerTinder

This project creates a poll allowing users to vote "yes" or "no" on a potential Tinder match. When everyone votes, the decision is applied.

## Components


1) Clients - web page that allows users to vote on the current match, and also talk to each other
2) Tinder driver - this is a user script that reads from an open tinder.com page, and applies decisions made by the server (swipe left, swipe right, open card, etc)
3) Server - talks to everyone and makes it nice
